1. 2^n + n! (bad problem)
2. Yes
3. By Pick's Theorem, we know that A = i+b/2-1, where i is the number of interior lattice points and b is then number of boundary lattice points. We have that b >= 5 and i >= 0, so it suffices
to show that i >= 1 or b >= 7. Case on the parity of the coordinates of the vertices (o,o), (o,e), (e,o), (e,e). Note that two vertices must have the same parity by pigeonhole. 
If the vertices are not adjacent, then the midpoint is an interior lattice point and we are done. Suppose the vertices are adjacent, denoted A and B. The other vertices are C, D, E. 
The midpoint is a boundary lattice point M. If any of A, C, D, E are the same parity then either we produce another boundary lattice or interior lattice and we are done. If M is the same parity 
as A, then we can simply take the midpoint of M and A to produce another boundary lattice and we are done. If M is not the same parity as A, then it must have the same parity as one of C,D,E, which
produces an interior lattice point and we are done.
