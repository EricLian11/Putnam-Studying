1. Take a cross section of the cone through the axis, and that includes two opposite vertices of the cube. Much easier to solve in 2d
2. Denote the two points in the first quadrant to be A and B. Connect A and B with the origin to create a triangle which area only depends on arc length. Do some manipulation and get the answer
3.
