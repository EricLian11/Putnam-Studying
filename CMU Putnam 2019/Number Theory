1. x^p-1+yx^p-2+...+y^p-1
2. Note that f(n) = 3^3^3... (n times). Note that 3^3 = 7 mod 10, and 7 = 3 mod 4. So every last digit for n greater than 2 is 7. 
3. Same thiing but the cycle of last two digits is a lot longer, get 87
4. Let S be the number of consecutive partitions, and C be the number of pairs that differ by 6. So S+C = 999. Then 6C+S = 999+5C. So it suffices
to show that 9+5c = 9 mod 10 -> c = 0 mod 2. Furthermore a+b = a-b mod 2 means that the sum of the differences is equivalent to the total sum which is
1998*1999/2 = 999*1999 = 1 mod 2 -> 999 + 5c = 1 mod 2 -> c = 0 mod 2.
6. (USAMO, My solution) 
Firstly note that the a_(k+2) <= (a_(k+1)+a_k)/2, with equality if and only if a_k+1 = a_k. Note that if a_k+1 = a_k, then the sequence is constant
after those terms. So we see that eventually the sequence will be constant. After trying out a couple of cases, we claim that a_n = gcd(r,s).
We aim to prove that k = gcd(a_n,a_(n+1)) is constant. 
Note that k | a_n and k|a_(n+1) -> k | a_n + a_(n+1) -> k | p = greatest odd divisor of a_n + a_(n+1). So 
p = kq for some odd q that is coprime with a_(n+1)/k by definition of gcd. Thus gcd(a_(n+1), p) = k so the gcd is constant and we are done. 
7. (USAMO, AOPS Solution).
Firstly note that a_n = 2^(a_(n-1)). Proceed with contradiction: Let b be the minimal integer for which the problem statement is false. 
Then by our first note, it implies that the sequence will eventually be cyclic mod b. Let the period of the cycle be k. Note that there are b-1 
non-zero residues. Because the sequence cannot become constant mod b, then the sequence cannot be 0 mod b. So 1 <= k <= b-1 < b. It follows that 
the sequence of exponents ccannot become constant mod k, contradicting the minimality of b.
