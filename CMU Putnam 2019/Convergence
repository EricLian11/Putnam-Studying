1. Integral comparison test (diverges)
2. Cauchy Condensation Test (f converges if and only if f(2^x) converges), converges
3. Integral comparison test (diverges)
4. The series is conditionally convergent by alternating series, so it follows by the Rearrangement Theorem/Riemman Theorem
5. Note that alternating sum of a_n must be convergent. Lump Bn into groups of 3: (-a3+a2-a1) + (a4-a5...), and compare it with the maximum so it converges
