1. The problem follows from the guess that 1,2,3,4,... is the optimal set. You can show by induction that |A_s| = 2n-3. It is easy to show that 
|A_s'| >= |A_s|+2

2. Note that 1+x+x^2+x^3 = (1+x)(1+x^2), and apply the binomial theorem. The result follows immediately afterwards

3. Whenever you see a convergence recurrence problem, start with computing the fixed point for intuition. Note that the fixed point is 1+sqrt(1-y^2). 
clearly if the magnitude of y is greater than 1, the discriminant is negative so there is no fixed point. Which means that it is only possible to
converge if |y| <= 1. Considering a simple case for intuition, set y = 0. Note that if x > 1+sqrt(1-y^2), then the sequence increases and does not converge.
So we claim that the sequence only converges if and only if |y| <= 1 and |x| <= 1+sqrt(1-y^2). We have shown from the determinant argument that
it must diverge if |y| > 1, so it remains to show that the sequence diverges if |y| <= 1 and |x| > 1+sqrt(1-y^2). Let epsilon be such that 
|x| > 1+sqrt(1-y^2) +epsilon. It follows that a1-a0 > e^2/2. By induction it follows that a_(n+1)-an > e^2/2. So it diverges. In the case that |y| <=1 
and |x| <= 1+sqrt(1-y^2), it obviously follows that the sequence monotonically decreases and is bounded below by 0, and furthermore every term in the
sequence is positive except for perhaps the first so converge follows

4. I think this problem is easier than problem 3. Firstly note that p(x) / x^3-x = g(x) + q(x)/x^3-x. We know the remainder is coprime with the denominator,
so it follows that p(x) / x^3-x = g(x) + a/ x + b/x-1 + c/x+1. Taking the derivative 1992 times, note that g(x) goes to 0 because it must have degree
less than 1992. So it remains a(x)^(-1993) + b(x-1)^(-1993)+c(x+1)^(-1993) = z -> a(x^2-1)^1993 + b(x^2+x)^1993+c(x^2-x)^1993 = z(x^3-x)^1993
So it follows that f = a(x^2-1)^1993 and b(x^2+x)^1993+c(x^2-x)^1993, and it reduces to getting this expression to the lowest possible degree.
To get rid of the 3986th degree, it is necessary for a+b+c =0. To get rid of 3985, it is necessary for b=c. To get rid of the 3984th degree, it
must be 1993a+(1993 choose 2)b+(1993 choose 2)c = 0, and it follows that there is now no solution to the system of equations. So we can only get rid of 
up to the 3985th degree, and the lowest possible degree is 3984.
