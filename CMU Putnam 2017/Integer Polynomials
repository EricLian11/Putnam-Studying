1. a. Homer wins if the polynomial has a root of 2012. Note that all terms with even degree must be positive. Homer has the last turn so he wins, noting
that there are an even number of terms with even degree. 
2. -> p(x) = 2008 = 2^3*251 -> has 8 positive factors -> 16 positive/negative factors, and
has at least 81 distinct integer solutions. Note that for every distinct integer solution, q(x) must be
one of the 16 factors. Suppose that q has a degree of 5. Then there is at most 5 distinct integers such that p(x) = one of the 16 factors.
Note that 5*16 = 80 so it follows by pigeonhole.
3. At first I thought the question was asking about polynomials of arbitrary degree. But it's quadratic which makes it easy. Obviously considering
f(0) implies that the constant term is divisible by 5. Then f(1) = a+b and f(-1) = a-b -> 2a = 5k -> 5 | a and similarly 5 | b.
4. Just consider quartic residues mod 29 to find that it implies 29|x and 29|y and 29|z.
