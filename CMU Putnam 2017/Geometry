1. Reflect the points across the line. It follows by the triangle inequality that the intersection of the diagonals of the convex quadrilateral formed
by the four points minimizes the sum
2. Algorithm where you connect each point to the nearest untaken point
3. Cauchy schwarz using the fact that sum (s_i ) <= 4
4 .
