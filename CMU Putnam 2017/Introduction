1. Symmetrical Purposes
2. Consider the midpoints of the line segments. There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of parities for a three-dimensional coordinate. 
Because there are 9 points, pigeonhole implies at least one combination of parities will be repeated.
So the midpoint of the line segment with those points as vertices is a lattice.
3. Suppose the squares are unit squares. Add in the missing white unit square at the bottom to create a right triangle. This right triangle will 
have area 7/2. The height is 3, so the width is 7/3. So the fraction of the side it takes up is ((7/3)-1)/(2) = 2/3. So the ratio is 2:1.
4. The amount each locker is toggled is equal to the number of factors they have. So a locker will be open if it has an odd number of factors.
Only perfect squares have odd number of factors. Note 45^2 = 2025, so there are 44 perfect squares less than 2013. 
5. f(S) is a convex set by definition, so it is its own convex hull. f(f(S)) will generate more points within the hull, and perhaps on the boundary
but the hull will remain constant. Same with f(f(f(S)))
6. Same as 5?
7. Count in to ways. LHS: Represents the number of ways to pick n people from x+y people in order. For the right side, order the x+y people randomly,
then put a divider between the first x people and the next y people. For any k, the expression represents the number of ways to pick n people
given there are exactly k people from the first x people.
