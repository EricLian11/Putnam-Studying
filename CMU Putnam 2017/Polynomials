2. 
Note that p(1) = 1 -> p(2) = 2 -> p(5) = 5 ->... which implies that p(z)-z has infinite roots which implies that p(z) - z is the zero polynomial. 
So p(z) = z is the unique solution. 
3. p(1) is greater than every coefficient. Let a be such that 10^a > 10*p(1). Then p(10^a) will tell you all the coefficients.
4. If p is the zero polynomial, then it has infinite roots. Suppose p is not the zero polynomial. The question reduces to the number of roots of p
plus the number of roots of p-1. Note that p = 1..

6. Take the integral of ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = 0 from 0 to 1, and set it equal to 1/2*(p(t1)+p(t2)). Solve the system for t1 and t2 to get 1/2 +- sqrt(3)/6.
