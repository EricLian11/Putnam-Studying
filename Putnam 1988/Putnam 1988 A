1. 6, by geometry and thinking
2. Just solve for g, noting that integral of g'/g is ln|g|
3. 
4. Suppose it is impossible. Famous coloring argument. Consider a triangle with AB = AC = sqrt(3), BC = 1. Then we can create equilateral triangles AXY, BXY with sides 1. X,Y take up two colors, 
so that means A and B are the same color. Similarly A and C are the same color. Thus B and C are the same color. But they are distance 1, so contradiction.
