1. Let x = a-1, y = b-1, z = 1. It follows clearly. 
2. Manipulate the equations to get that the first equation is (y+1/2)^2 / (1/2)^2 - (x+1)^2 / (1/2)^2 <= 1 and (y-1/2)^2 / (1/2)^2 - x^2/(1/2)^2 <= 1. Plotting these two 
hyperbolas, we see that we only consider the portion of the hyperbolas that are at or above the x-axis. They have the exact same shape, and the vertex of the second hyperbola is above the first.
It follows that we only need to show that neither of the two equations cross at any point. AFSOC that they do intersect. So they must satisfy both equations y(y+1) = (x+1)^2 and y(y-1) = x^2, and
we easily get a contradiction.

4. Note that 2a_n < a_n ^(n/n+1). It follows that a_n < 1/2^(n+1), which converges. So either 2a_n > a_n^(n/n+1), or 1/2^(n+1) > a_n, and we know both 2a_n and 1/2^(n+1) both converge
so by direct comparison we are done.
