1. First of all, note that the constant coefficient is zero if and only if one of the roots is zero. Note that if one of the roots is zero, then
the coefficient of the x term cannot be 0 because of Vieta's formulas and the fact that the roots are distinct. Let us first consider the quartic problem.
Clearly k = 2 for the polynomial and cubic cases. AFSOC that k = 2. Note that the non-zero coefficient cannot be of the x^3 or x^2 term, otherwise
it implies a double root of 0. Suppose the non-zero coefficient is of the x term. Then x(x^3-k) where k is a constant, which implies the existence
of complex roots. Suppose the non-zero coefficient is the constant term. Then x^4-k, which again implies the existence of complex terms. So k = 3
for the quartic case, an example being (x^2-1)(x^2-4) = x^4-5x^2+4. Now in a polynomial with degree 5, let one of the roots be zero. Then it reduces to 
the quartic case. So the answer is k = 3, with an example being x(x^4-5x^2+4). 
2. It is clear that f_n(x) are polynomials of degree n with leading coefficient 1. It is shown by induction that f_n(x) = x(x+n)^(n-1). Note that
induction follows from the fact that (n+1)(x+1)(x+n+1)^(n-1) = (n+1)(x+n+1)^n-n(n+1)(x+n+1)^(n-1). So
f_100(1) = (101)^99 -> prime factorization is just 101. 
3. AFSOC every a_(m,n) <= mn. Note that the number of ordered pairs (i,j) <= N is sum floor (N/k), which is >= N(1+1/2+...+1/N)-N. But the harmonic
series diverges, which means that 1+1/2+..+1/N necessarily becomes greater than 9 for sufficiently large N. So there exists N such that
the number of ordered pairs (i,j) is greater than 8N, which implies that there must be a a_(m,n) > mn by pigeonhole (Not my solution)
4. P=(cos theta, sin theta). Then take integral to get 4/pi^2
