1. The fraction which results from the sum of the numerators and the sum of the denominotors of two distinct fractions will be strictly between the original two fractions. It remains to show that
it is the smallest such fraction, which can be shown by considering minimal cases. 
2. 0. ? B is guaranteed to win on the first turn?
3. If 2x < y, then the closest integer to x/y will be 0. Otherwise 2n if 2x/4n+1 < y < 2x/4n-1. Draw a picture with a unit square and the intersections
with the lines y = 2x, y=2x/3, y=2x/5,... to see that the desired probability is 1/4+1/3-1/5+1/7-1/9+... Note that pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9...
So the result is 5/4-pi/4.
