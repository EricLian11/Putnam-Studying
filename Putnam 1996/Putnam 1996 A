1. Let x,y be the square side lengths. So we have x^2+y^2 = 1. WLOG x >= y, then the area of the rectangle is (x+y)*x = x^2+x*sqrt(1-x^2). Take the derivative wtr x, and set equal to 0, and solve
for x. Plug back into (x+y)*x and find the area
2. Denote C_1 = (0,0) and C_2 = (10,0). HOMOTHETIES! Fix a point Y on C_2, and note that the midpoints form a circle, that is half of C_1 by homothety. Note that the center of this circle is just 
the midpoint of the line segment formed by the center of C_1 and Y. Therefore, we can generate the locus by the union of all circles of radius 1/2 with centers that are the midpoint of the
center of C_1 and some point Y on C_2. This forms a ring with outer radius 2 and inner radius 1. 
3. False by intuition. In cases like these, try a uniform generation. Note that 6 choose 3 = 20, so consider the case where every student has a unique subset of size 3. There are 4 subsets of size
3 that contain C_a and C_b,and similarly there are 4 subsets of size 3 that exlcude C_a and C_b. Thus we have constructed a class arrangement which does not satisfy the requirement.
