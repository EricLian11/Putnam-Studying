1. Write the number of selfish subsets of small values of n, denote them as f_n. Observe that it follows the fibonacci sequence. Counting in 
two ways type proof follows.
2. Interesting trick. Firstly it immediately suggests taking the natural log of the inequality. From here, we consider the sum ln(1)+ln(3)+...+ln(2n-1).
Note ln(1) = 0. Then 2(ln(3)+...+ln(2n-1)) is bounded aove and below by the integral of lnx from 1 to 2n-1, and 3 to 2n+1 respectively by estimations
