1. Note that at least four values of x must have the same pi(x) value equality if (partition of sizes 2,3,4). Consider the elements in the partition of size 4, and note that they cannot all
have different pi'(x) values, since 1+2+3+4 = 10  > 9, so by pigeonhole two of them must have the same pi'(x) value and we are done
2. 
3. n= 2 -> 45^2*10 by symmetry
