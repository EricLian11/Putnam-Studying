1. Consider the following partition: [1,2,4,8,..], [3,6,12,24,..],[5,10,20,...]. There are n odd numbers, so there are n elements in the partition. 
By pigeonhole, two of the numbers in a n+1 subset must belong to the same element in the partition. 
2. Note that in order to produce four points where every distance is at least 1/sqrt(2), they must be in different quadrants. The fifth point must be in
one of the quadrants, so the distance between the fifth point and the original point in that quadrant must be less than 1/sqrt(2)
3. Note that F can only contain one singleton set X. It follows that F contains all subsets which has X as a subset. This is exactly half the total subsets.
